# GEO-BallTree — High-Performance Geospatial Ball Tree System

## Overview
GEO-BallTree is a C++ implementation designed for efficient organization, retrieval, and analysis of large-scale geospatial datasets. It leverages the Ball Tree data structure, which partitions data into hyperspherical regions, enabling efficient similarity searches and spatial filtering.

This system focuses on two main operations:
1. **Construction** — Reading raw geospatial data from CSV and building a Ball Tree optimized for both attribute similarity and spatial locality.
2. **Querying** — Performing fast *k*-nearest neighbor (KNN) searches and clustering with geographic constraints.

By serializing both the dataset and the Ball Tree to binary format, it allows near-instantaneous loading of large datasets without reconstructing the tree.

## Why Ball Tree?
For high-dimensional attribute vectors combined with geospatial coordinates, Ball Trees offer:
- **Faster queries** than brute force: \\(O(\\log n)\\) average for well-balanced trees versus \\(O(n)\\) for exhaustive search.
- **Better partitioning** than KD-Trees in higher dimensions, as partitions are hyperspherical instead of axis-aligned.
- **Flexibility** to incorporate custom distance metrics, such as Haversine distance for coordinates combined with Euclidean distance for attributes.

## Computational Complexity
- **Construction:** \\(O(n \\log n)\\) average, \\(O(n^2)\\) worst-case if splits are poorly chosen.
- **KNN Query:** \\(O(\\log n)\\) average for balanced trees, worst-case \\(O(n)\\).
- **Range Query:** Similar to KNN but dependent on radius; pruning reduces visits significantly.
- **Serialization/Deserialization:** \\(O(n)\\) with low constant factors due to sequential binary I/O.

## Practical Advantages
1. **Large Dataset Handling** — Binary serialization avoids expensive rebuilds.
2. **Geospatial Filtering** — Bounding box checks prune large portions of the tree early.
3. **Hybrid Distance Metrics** — Combine spatial and attribute similarity for richer results.
4. **Extensibility** — Can integrate clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, K-Means) directly over tree-filtered subsets.
